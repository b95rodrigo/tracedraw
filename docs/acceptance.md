# Acceptance criteria

Each criterion below is either an existing test or a planned acceptance
gate. A feature is accepted only after its actual check passes; the
existence of a documented criterion is not proof that CI runs it.
See [compatibility-matrix.md](compatibility-matrix.md) for independently
verified workflows and the distinction between claimed and tested coverage.

## Visual regression

**Planned, not yet enforced:** the `tests/visual/expected/` directory and
`tests/visual` harness are not present in the 2026-10-21 repository tree.
The following criteria describe the gate that must be implemented.

- Reference PNGs will live in `tests/visual/expected/`; `tests/visual` will render
  each `.tdraw` fixture at 96 dpi and compares.
- Metric: per-pixel RMSE over RGB, normalised to 0..1. Threshold 0.01
  (1%) per image, and no more than 0.5% of pixels differing by more than
  32/255 in any channel.
- Fonts: fixtures that contain text embed the font file next to them so
  the comparison does not depend on system fonts.
- Updating a reference requires a reviewed change in the same commit.

## Round trips

- `.tdraw`: save, load, compare the `Document` structurally (serde
  equality). Every command variant has a round-trip fixture.
- `.cdr`: open a fixture, export `.tdraw`, re-open, compare object count,
  bounding boxes (0.01 mm), fill and outline attributes. The proposed per-version fixture directory is
  `tests/cdr/`, which is not present yet. Existing CDR writing tests are
  in `crates/cdr/src/write/tests.rs`.
- SVG and PDF: export, rasterise with an independent tool (resvg for
  SVG, pdftoppm for PDF, both in CI), compare to our render with the
  visual metric at 2% threshold.

## Performance (release build, CI runner, median of 5)

| Scenario | Budget |
|---|---|
| Open a `.tdraw` with 500 objects | under 300 ms |
| Open a `.cdr` with 500 objects | under 500 ms |
| Render a page of 1000 simple objects at 100% zoom, 1600x1000 | under 16 ms |
| Render a page of 5000 objects | under 100 ms |
| Undo or redo of any command on a 1000-object document | under 50 ms |
| Select all + move on 1000 objects (one frame) | under 16 ms |
| Export PDF of 1000 objects | under 1 s |
| Startup to first frame | under 1 s |

Benchmarks are `cargo bench` targets in `crates/render/benches` and
`crates/io/benches`; CI fails when a median exceeds its budget by more
than 20%.

## Robustness

- Mutation testing of every reader: `tracedraw-cli stress <file> [n]`
  feeds `n` damaged copies of a file (truncated, byte flips, cut spans,
  overwritten words) to the reader its extension selects and fails on
  any panic. The `.cdr`, PDF, AI, EPS, DXF, PSD, EMF, WMF and SVG readers pass
  hundreds of iterations on the files in the test corpus.
- Fuzzing of the `.cdr` reader (`cargo fuzz`) with the RIFF and ZIP
  targets: no panic, no allocation over 1 GB, on 10 minutes of input.
- Opening any file yields a document, possibly empty, with a warning
  list; this is a unit test on truncated and corrupted fixtures.

## Behaviour checks

- Each page in `docs/behavior/` lists checks ("given, when, then") that
  are unit tests in the owning crate. A row of `docs/features.md` moves to "works" only
  when those tests pass.
- Interaction smoke run (`scripts/visual/run.sh scripts/visual/smoke_edit.py`): draw one of every
  box tool, a freehand curve and text; select all; group, ungroup,
  combine, break apart and convert to curves; drop shadow and
  transparency drags; zoom and pan; add a page; open every panel tab.
  The process must still be running at the end with no panic in the log
  (Ctrl+Q once closed the application through egui's default quit
  shortcut; it is Convert to Curves). The same sequence runs headless in
  `ops::smoke_tests`. `scripts/visual/monkey.py` (MONKEY_SEED, MONKEY_STEPS)
  runs random clicks, drags, keys and chords; seeds 1 to 6 with 150 steps
  survive with no panic.
- Headless UI tests run the egui interface without a window
  (`egui::Context::run_ui`): `ui::dialogs::tests` draws every dialog over
  a document with a rectangle, text and a bitmap and presses Enter in
  each; `ui::menus::tests` clicks every enabled row of all twelve menus
  (submenus inlined through the `replay` hook) against a mixed document
  of rectangle, ellipse, text, bitmap and table, skipping only the rows
  that open a native file chooser, another program or close the window.
  `ui::tests` draws the whole window with every panel tab, every tool
  and each kind of selection, and drives every tool with pointer events
  (drags across the page and from an object, clicks on an object, on
  empty space and with the right button, then Esc). All must pass with
  no panic and a page left in the document.
- `.cdr` writing: a document with a rectangle (radius, dashed outline,
  name, transparency), a radial gradient ellipse, a transformed curve with
  a CMYK fill, bold text, a group, a 2 x 2 bitmap and a second page is
  written in every version from 7 to 27 and read back with every value
  within 0.05 mm (from version 15 the rectangle comes back as the curve
  it draws; tests in `crates/cdr/src/write/tests.rs`); truncated and
  bit-flipped copies of written files of versions 7, 12, 13, 15 and 21
  never panic the reader.

## CI execution scope (2026-10-21)

The legacy `test` job ran only non-application workspace crates and
excluded `tracedraw`. The application includes in-crate interactive and UI
tests. The build workflow must now run those app tests under a virtual
X11 display, with the Linux GUI build dependencies installed, before
publishing release artifacts.

The inventory check `scripts/ci/check_feature_status.py` validates the
self-reported table counts; it does not validate product behavior. The
independent visual and performance harnesses above remain future work.

Windows and macOS release builds are not equivalent to running each
platform's interaction tests. Platform-specific tests and real-machine
checks remain necessary before declaring cross-platform verification.
